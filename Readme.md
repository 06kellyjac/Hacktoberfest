At Aqua, we believe open source is an essential part of our success and growth, and that by building our open source community and we help improve security across the cloud native ecosystem.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
For some people October is a month of beer, and for others (like us) itâ€™s hacking time! Hacktoberfest, named after the famous [German festival Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest), is a wonderful initiative that invites developers from around the world to participate and contribute to Open Source.  
Many projects and companies participate in Hacktoberfest by encouraging contributions in different ways, like rewarding you with prizes!  
Besides individual campaigns, there's also the primary [Hacktoberfest campaign](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) where you can learn more about Hacktoberfest, which projects and companies participate, and also apply for more rewards.

## What is Aqua Security doing for Hacktoberfest?
All year long, everyone is welcome to join our communities and contribute to our projects, but for contributions made during October 2020, we will reward you with prizes according to the following criteria:

Criteria | Prize
--- | ---
1 contribution | Aqua Open Source sticker pack or Aqua Open Source face mask for your choosing
4 contributions | Aqua Open Source sticker pack and Aqua Open Source face mask for your choosing and Aqua Hacktoberfest t-shirt
Top 3 contributors | special gift!

## How can I help?
We are looking for meaningful contributions to our open source projects. For example: Adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, integrating with other software, even creating content in other places that educates about our projects can count.

Please focus your attentions to the following projects:
1. [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)
2. [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/Trivy)
3. [Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee)
4. [Startboard](https://github.com/aquasecurity/Starboard)
5. [kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter)

### External contributions
You can contribute to our projects in many ways besides Pull Requests to our projects. We recognize two types of so called External Contributions:

**Out of repo**: Some contributions are about integrating our tools with other tools. Not always these integrations belong in the main repository of the project, sometimes it makes more sense to create another repository for these integration projects. For example: Integrating Trivy with a CI system, or integrating the Starboard report with some dashboard tool.

**Non-code**: Sometimes Open Source contributions are not about code at all. For example, you could make a video explaining our tools, or write an article about how you used it, which creates value and helps the ecosystem just as much as writing code. The content you create can be any of the following categories:
1. Introduction - present the project for new comers.
2. Review - tell people what you think about the project and why you like it.
3. Tutorial - technically explain how to complete a certain task.
4. Case study - present how you (or the company you work for) have used this tool, or are planning to use it.

## Contribution workflow

1. Only contributions to the participating repos will be considered.
2. Eligible contributions must start with a Github Issue describing the work item.
    1. For any contribution, first look for an existing Issue, and if needed open an Issue in the project's repo.
    2. Issue can also be opened in this repository ([Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/aquasecurity/Hacktoberfest)) if they don't belong in the project's repo.
    3. For non-code contributions, please create the issue in this repository ([Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/aquasecurity/Hacktoberfest)).
3. Create a Pull Request with your contribution.
    1. Read the contributions guidelines for the relevant project.
    2. Link to the relevant Issue in the PR description.
    3. External contributions: please create the PR to the [contrib-integrations.md](contrib-integrations.md) document adding your work.
    4. Non-code contributions: please create the PR to the [contrib-content.md](contrib-content.md) document adding your work.
4. A maintainer will label eligible PRs with the `#hacktoberfest-approved` label.
5. Claim your prize by filling out the [following form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=80wDvGtWykGfJF3ElHSwXoMzxQ44cLZDuLrHx6o4yX1UNklOSjVNOVFCSUtMVkVKR1VEU1haQVpUOS4u).

## I have questions
If you want to discuss a particular contribution, it's best to discuss in context at the  related Github Issue or PR.  
For anything else regarding our Hacktoberfest campaign, you can engage in conversation with us using the [Discussions](https://github.com/aquasecurity/Hacktoberfest/discussions) tab in this repository.
