# Hello and welcome to Aqua Security Hacktoberfest 2020!

At Aqua, we believe open source is an essential part of our success and growth, and that by building our open source community and we help improve security across the cloud native ecosystem.


## What is Hacktoberfest?
For some people October is a month of beer, and for others (like us) itâ€™s hacking time! Hacktoberfest, named after the famous [German festival Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest), is a wonderful initiative that invites developers from around the world to participate and contribute to Open Source.  
Many projects and companies participate in Hecktoberfest by encouraging contibutions in different ways, like rewarding you with prizes!  
Besides individual campaigns, there's also the primary [Hacktoberfest campain](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) where you can learn more about Hacktoberfest, which projects and companies participate, and also apply for more rewards.
